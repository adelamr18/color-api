# Frontify Color API

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

The goal of this task is to create a simple RESTful API for **CRUD (creating, reading, updating and deleting)** 
operations on the Color entity. This project already contains VCS and minimal skeleton for the implementation. Develop 
on top of the existing boilerplate and history. The idea is to show us your coding style and how well and proper you can
engineer solutions, even for simple problems. Do it as well as you would expect for a code review by yourself. Don't 
spend too much time though â€“ _perfect is the enemy of good_ after all.

## Installation, Test & Execution

**Requirements:** PHP 7.3+, node.js (optional, format the code manually if you can't use Prettier).

We use [http-server-request](https://github.com/sunrise-php/http-server-request) to abstract PHP's `$_SERVER`
and `$_REQUEST` superglobals, [Prettier for PHP](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-php) for code-formatting
and [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for testing:

```shell
npm i && php composer.phar install
```

Run the built-in server available at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080):

```shell
npm start
```

Execute the PHPUnit tests via NPM shortcut:

```shell
npm test
```

## Your Task

- Implement CRUD operations for the Color entity. A Color should have a name and the hex color value.
- Add standard behavior one can expect of a RESTful API.
- Feel free to use any RDBMS.
- Make simple, elegant software that you can explain and elaborate well during the demonstration.
- Provide production-ready code quality (everything what you would usually do, when you ship the code).

## Rules Of The Game

- Don't use any further library or framework.
- You have to write your code â€” no code generators or assistants allowed (e.g. GitHub Copilot).
- Feel free to change existing code (or fix existing problems) as you see fit.
- Don't share the code publicly, just send it back to us.
- **Enjoy!**
