# Frontify Color API

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

The goal of this task is to show us how you code and have a basis for discussion in a follow-up call. This is no test,
and it's fine if you don't implement the task completely. Give us enough to see where you stand as developer, what your
values are and how your style is.

For this purpose, create a simple RESTful API for **CRUD (creating, reading, updating and deleting)** operations  on a 
Color entity. It's fine to just develop a few operations if you're short on time. Work on top of the existing skeleton 
and Git history. For the features you implement, show us your coding style and how well and proper you can engineer 
solutions, even for simple problems. Do it as well as you would expect for a code review by yourself.

Keep in mind, we need a basis for discussion, not a fully-fledged enterprise solution. Thus keep an eye on the time you 
spend.

## Installation, Test & Execution

**Requirements:** PHP 7.3+, node.js (optional, format the code manually if you can't use Prettier).

We use [http-server-request](https://github.com/sunrise-php/http-server-request) to abstract PHP's `$_SERVER`
and `$_REQUEST` superglobals, [Prettier for PHP](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-php) for code-formatting
and [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for testing:

```shell
npm i && php composer.phar install
```

Run the built-in server available at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080):

```shell
npm start
```

Execute the PHPUnit tests via NPM shortcut:

```shell
npm test
```

## Your Task

- Implement CRUD operations for the Color entity â€“ or a subset thereof. A Color should have a name and the hex color 
  value.
- Add standard behavior one can expect of a RESTful API.
- Feel free to use any RDBMS.
- Make simple, elegant software that you can explain and elaborate well during the follow-up discussion.
- Provide production-ready code quality (everything what you would usually do, when you ship the code).

## Rules of the Game

- Don't use any further library or framework.
- You have to write your code â€” no code generators or assistants allowed (e.g. GitHub Copilot).
- Feel free to change existing code (or fix existing problems) as you see fit.
- Don't share the code publicly, just send it back to us.
- **Enjoy!**
